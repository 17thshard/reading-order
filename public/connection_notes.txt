Had these as Sixth of the Dusk sequel connections and removed. Maybe need to be readded at publication of IotE:

							"connections": [
								{
									"target": "mb6",
									"type": "minor",
									"description": "<a target='_blank' href='https://coppermind.net/wiki/Scadrial'>Scadrian</a> spaceships powered by <a target='_blank' href='https://coppermind.net/wiki/Allomancy'>Allomancy</a> are seen."
								},
								{
									"target": "tsm",
									"type": "egg",
									"description": "<a target='_blank' href='https://coppermind.net/wiki/Scadrial'>Scadrians</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://coppermind.net/wiki/Roshar>Rosharan</a> <a target='_blank' href='https://coppermind.net/wiki/Surgebinding>Surgebinders</a> are first seen to be in conflict."
								}


Additional Isles of the Emberdark connections:

Obviously the stuff in the prologue with Starling and Frost on Yolen would be Dragonsteel and possibly WoR as that was the first canon mention of Frost.
Aditil being an aetherbound from Dhatri (connects to TLM at least until AoN releases) using zephyr spores (connects to TotES)
isis being the owner of the ship (not sure if it would be ToTES, his most prominent appearance, or RoW, his first mention)
Nazh (so N) is now a shade (SfSitFoH, although I think we might actually see him die in Book of Nails)
Chrysalis is a Sleepless (similar to Xisis not sure if Dawnshard or Edgedancer)
Added reference to Kingmakers (Kingmaker obviously)
Just the name Emberdark which a settlement in the Rosharan subastral shares its name (Oathbringer)
We have a Skybreaker or at least a bonded shardbearer (not sure which of SA this would go to)
Patji's Eye being a shardpool might be too general
Starlight is Hoid's apprentice (so H) who was originally going to be Kite Magic book protagonist (not sure about this one since Brandon isn't sure it will still be her)
If Sixth of the Dusk is moved to mixed not sure if its lines should be switched to Isles of the Emberdark
